        <h2>Haiku</h2>
        <p>Inspired by my dearest series known to many as ATLA</p>
        <p>Squish, squash, sling that slang.<br>
        I'm always right back at ya,<br>
        like my boomerang.</p>

        <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the Southeast, where warm weather reigns and the beach always calls my name. Naturally, I enjoy anything involving water and heat. This includes surfing, snuba, walking on the beach, seashell collecting, and tanning. I particularly love my summer vacations, when I try to return to my home state and spend a week at a condo right next to the beach.</p>

        <p>In Utah, I picked up a new hobbyâ€”pickleball. This sport is incredibly fun and appeals to a wide range of ages, though its popularity has only recently begun to rise. Because of that, there's about twenty people wanting to play for every one court available. Since each court can accommodate a maximum of four players (when playing doubles), it's often crowded. Currently, my skill level is classified as a 3.5, which, for those unfamiliar, means I'm considered pretty good.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite activities is walking my two dogs around my parents' neighborhood. Their names are Russell and Ollie. Russell is an eight-and-a-half-year-old Goldendoodle, and Ollie is a five-year-old Labradoodle. They are definitely a handful, but their colorful personalities are always on display. I cherish their company and, as I mentioned earlier, enjoy our walks, which I try to make last at least half an hour.</p>
